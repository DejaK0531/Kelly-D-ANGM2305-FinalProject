## Description
"Rocket Kitty Blast!" is a "Space Invaders" inspired/replica using sprites that I have hand drawn and implimented into the game. This replica has all the 'Space Invader' charm and gameplay of the original except with a twitst, it features Space Cats! I made orange cats the main species (and main character) of the game due to their chaotic energy. As they rocket off into the depths of space, you as the player battle your fellow sister and brother cats who have unfornately turned into aliens! Can you stop them and bring justice to this empty space full of cats? Watch the demo above!

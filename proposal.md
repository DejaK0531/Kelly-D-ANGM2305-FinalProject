# Title
Rocket Kitty Blast!
## Repository
<Link to your project's public GitHub respository>

## Description
This code will be inspired by my favorite arcade game series growing up, Space Invaders and Galaxian (or Galaga, as most people know the second installment), except I add a twist to the interface. I will be making cats the main species of the game as they fight off aliens as space kitties! Through this program I will show how coding in digital art sprites contribute to the creation of some of your favorite games, showing how this code is relavant to the digital arts. 

## Features
- Game Loop
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Highscore/scoring
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Tiny Obstacles/Collisions  
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Game Over and Sound 
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is to replicate an old-fashioned arcane game with one of my favorite animals as the protagonist, while learning certain game mechanics such as loops and dead-ends that are found in presesnt games today. The game should loop, showing an indication of game over, scoring must be prevelant, sprites are colorful and in use, collisions and obsticles are working, etc.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- If this projects more difficult than needed, the bare essentials are to have all the sprites working (may not be as colorful as established), the act of shooting is present, and if i can't have multiple enemies at least have one working enemy. Game loop and obsticles/collisionshas to work. Sound is not that much of a priority so it is ok if it doesn't work as expected, due to time constraints.

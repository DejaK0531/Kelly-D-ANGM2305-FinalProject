# Title
Rocket Kitty Blast!
## Repository
https://github.com/DejaK0531/Kelly-D-ANGM2305-FinalProject.git

## Description
This code will be inspired by my favorite arcade game series growing up, Space Invaders and Galaxian (or Galaga, as most people know the second installment), except I add a twist to the interface. I will be making cats the main species of the game as they fight off aliens as space kitties! Through this program I will show how coding in digital art sprites contribute to the creation of some of your favorite games, showing how this code is relavant to the digital arts. 

## Features
- Game Loop
	- Using Booleans and while/for loops, I should display the game looping after a game over.
- Highscore/scoring
	- To do so, I will declare and initialize two variables: score and score_increment. The score variable will keep track of the player's current score, and the score_increment variable will specify the highest score the player made. This will also use a while loop and if statements
- Tiny Enemies/Collisions  
	- Most likely, I will be using a random radiant in an event loop to execute random spawning of enemies
- Game Over and Sound 
	- Using pygame.dispalay I will display the text of game. Using royalty free music I will have a sound for shooting and a sound when something has been hit.

## Challenges
- Need to learn how to create working collisions in python
- Need to learn how to import sound into python
- Need to learn how to load sprites into python

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is to replicate an old-fashioned arcane game with one of my favorite animals as the protagonist, while learning certain game mechanics such as loops and dead-ends that are found in presesnt games today. The game should loop, showing an indication of game over, scoring must be prevelant, sprites are colorful and in use, collisions and obsticles are working, etc.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- If this projects more difficult than needed, the bare essentials are to have all the sprites working (may not be as colorful as established), the act of shooting is present, and if i can't have multiple enemies at least have one working enemy. Game loop and obsticles/collisions have to work. Sound is a difficult task due to if i'm allowed and able to use and find royalty free sounds, via permission of the instructor. It is not that much of a priority so it is ok if it doesn't work as expected, due to also time constraints.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create sprites of space kitty(ship?), enemies, background, and bullets. Also research royalty free sounds that can be used.
  2. Start creating game loop and game over code

- Week 2
  1. Import sprites into my code as well as continue working on game loop (specifically how the space kitty and enemies move).
  2. Check/creating collisions between bullets and enemies

- Week N (Final)
  1. Add important text throughout game such as game over screen, score count code, highscore code, etc.
  2. (Of course if time allows) Impporting sound and testing final game.
